# Identifying Patient Features Predictive of Emergency Department Use

### Hofstra University Department of Mathematics X Harmony Healthcare Long Island

### Abstract
As their final project for Math 138 in the Spring of 2025, the students served as statistical consultants for Harmony Healthcare with the goal of identifying patient features which would be predictive of whether a patient would use the emergency room.  This information is useful for helping to direct patients to earlier interventions with better outcomes and at a lower cost than using the emergency department.  This project involves processing the raw data set (such as removing empty columns and formatting text) and visualizing the relationships between the variables and emergency room admissions.  The clean data set is used to identify a group of variables which are most predictive of whether a patient will use the emergency department using feature selection.  The selected features will be evaluated using cross-validation and metrics which account for imbalanced data.
